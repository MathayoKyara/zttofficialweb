# Immediate Fix for Vercel Build Error

## The Problem
Vercel is trying to run `bash build.sh` which fails because:
- Flutter installation takes too long (639MB download)
- Build times out
- Exit code 1 error

## The Solution (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Build Locally

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter build web --release
```

This creates the `build/web` folder with all your static files.

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

**Method 1: Vercel CLI (Easiest)**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login (if not already)
vercel login

# Deploy
cd build/web
vercel --prod
```

**Method 2: Vercel Dashboard**

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Your project → Settings → Git → **Disconnect**
3. Go to Deployments
4. Click "..." → "Redeploy" 
5. Or create new project and drag/drop `build/web` folder

## What I Changed

✅ **Updated `vercel.json`** - Removed the failing build command
✅ **Created deployment guide** - Step-by-step instructions

## Why This Works

- No build timeouts
- No Flutter installation needed on Vercel
- Fast and reliable
- Works every time

## For Future Updates

Every time you make changes:

```bash
# 1. Build
flutter build web --release

# 2. Deploy  
cd build/web
vercel --prod
```

Or use the script:
```bash
./deploy-to-vercel.sh
```
