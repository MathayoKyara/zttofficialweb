# Fix for Git Ownership Error

## The Error
```
fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/vercel/path0/flutter'
```

This happens because:
- Flutter SDK contains a `.git` directory
- Git detects ownership mismatch in Vercel's build environment
- Security feature prevents accessing repositories with different ownership

## Solution Applied

I've updated `build.sh` to:
1. ✅ Fix Git ownership issues automatically
2. ✅ Add Flutter directory to Git safe directories
3. ✅ Disable file mode checks that cause issues
4. ✅ Handle both new and existing Flutter installations

## What Changed

The build script now:
- Sets Git safe directories before Flutter operations
- Fixes ownership issues in Flutter's `.git` directory
- Handles the project's Git directory as well

## Alternative: Skip Build Entirely (Recommended)

Since Vercel builds are problematic, the **best solution** is still to build locally:

```bash
# Build locally
flutter build web --release

# Deploy to Vercel
cd build/web
vercel --prod
```

This avoids all Git ownership issues entirely.

## If You Must Build on Vercel

The updated `build.sh` should now handle the Git ownership error. However, you may still encounter:
- Build timeouts (Flutter is 639MB)
- Other environment issues

**Recommendation:** Use local build + deploy method instead.

**Status:** Build script updated to handle Git ownership errors ✅
